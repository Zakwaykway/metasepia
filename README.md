# metasepia
A hummingbird-esque keyboard, inspired by jcmkk3's rufous.
Notable changes:
  - more aggressive stagger (especially on index),
  - xiao footprints for rp2040 and nRF52840,
  - hotswap MX switches,
  - and a breakable third pinky key with the same input as the top pinky key.

v7 is the only one tested; fully functional with both xiao rp2040 & xiao nrf52840.


An intensive learning experience.

To jcmkk3 for the original inspiration to make my own hummingbird. To petejohanson and the ZMK contributors for the firmware.
