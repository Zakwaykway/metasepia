# metasepia

A personalized hummingbird-based keyboard featuring: top and bottom row pinky, aggressive index stagger, xiao zmk AND xiao qmk support, mx hotswap, and a flexible ergogen config.

An intensive learning experience. Credits to mrzealot, ceoloide, and flatfootfox for the ergogen part. To the fingerpunch and zmk servers for general questions. To jcmkk3 for the original inspiration to make my own hummingbird. To everyone who open-sourced their kicad footprints. Thanks to Cirrata for board name inspo, and to Sandra & Yang for their art.
